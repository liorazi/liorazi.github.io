After WWDC 2019 was over and most of the attendees having the ðŸ¤¯, I was looking to experiment a bit with some of the new technologies that were announced in the conference: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) & [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).
My lack of experience in both declarative UI & reactive programming just made it even more interesting for me,
"This is the future", they all said - so I decided to give it a shot.

Being a great fan of Formula 1 and loving UI Design led me to choose my experiment - the recreation of one the current F1 TV Widgets - The Leaderboard.

## What is a Leaderboard?

The Leaderboard is "the scoreboard" of racing sports, which by viewing it you get information about the current place of every participating driver in the race.
